BTC TECHNICAL MATERIALS SEARCH

This project will serve as a search engine for searching Bitcoin technical related materials. It will aggregate all Bitcoin related materials and performs search on those materials instead of going through thousands of unrelated Google search results. 

It will classify materials according to:

- Relevance
- Domains
- Tags
- Authors
